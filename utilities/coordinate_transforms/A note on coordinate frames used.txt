There are three frames typically used in the CR3BP:
    - B_i is inertially fixed @ the barycenter
    - E_i is an ECI frame - colinear to B_i and centered @ Earth
    - R_i is coincident to B_i and rotates at a const. rate 'n'

Vectors written in coordinates...
    - B_i are called 'alpha'-vectors
    - R_i are called 'a'-vectors
    - E_i are called 'A'-vectors

Relationships between 'a' and 'A' are derived in my Squid notes
and are implemented in the functions contained within this folder

Process for using these functions:
    - Rotating coordinates to dim. ECI
        1) Dimensionalize rotating coordinate vectors
        2) Mean motion is = 1/t_star
        3) Dimensionalize time
        4) Feed these into 'Ri_to_Ei.m' to get dimensional ECI coords
    - dim. ECI coordinates to rotating
        1) Feed dimensional state and time into 'Ei_to_Ri.m'
            - Mean motion is = 1/t_star
        2) Nondimensionalize state and time vectors
